How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

  When considering the functionality of a software package it is vital to perform Border Analysis to produce the appropriate test cases; from this point you will be able to ensure that buffer overflows, null pointer errors,
  and other inappropriate datas are not carried through your software package allowing for illegal access and systems failures by the implementation of various JUnit tests to confirm that the test cases are rejected by the system you've developed.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

  When determining a client's requirements for a system it is paramount to perform a formal interview to develop a vision of the software package with the client, confirming expectations and offering input upon vaguely realized features, so that
  the product will not only provide an intuitive user experience and efficient utilization of system resources but also allow the development team to easily of expand and reform the software product. 


How do I approach designing software?

  When designing software a developer should analyse the data collected during an interview with the client, describing the desired software, to determine the classes required to produce a feature of the software package, then ponder the 
  processes required for these classes to interact seemlessly through the drafting of UML Activity Diagrams, followed by how these features will integrate together to become the final software product. After this analysis process 
  UML Class Diagrams should be developed for each of the classes considered earlier followed by UML Activity Diagrams, UML Sequence Diagrams, and etc to confirm that operations will be performed in a predictable fashion. After the development
  of UML Class Diagrams, UML Activity Diagrams and UML Sequence Diagrams for each feature of the software package it becomes essential to design the system's UI and inter-feature processes through the inception of addition UML Activity Diagrams, 
  UML CLass Diagrms, UML Sequence Diagrams, etc to accurately describe the global system operations to the implmentation team.
